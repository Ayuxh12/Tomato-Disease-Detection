1. Download the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Ayuxh12/Tomato-Disease-Detection.git

2. Enter the project folder:
   cd Tomato-Disease-Detection

3. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

4. Activate the environment:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

5. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
